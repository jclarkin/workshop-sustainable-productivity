## Apps
[**Headspace**](http://www.headspace.com) is a great app for meditation. It's also the most expensive. Try their 10 free sessions and see if you like it.

[**Calm.com**](http://www.calm.com) is another popular choice, and more affordable than Headspace.

[**Thriver**](http://www.thriver.io) is the product I'm working on. In addition to guided and unguided meditations, Thriver also helps your organization track stress levels on a team basis. The app is free forever with no strings attached.

[**Self-Control**](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) shuts down distracting websites.

[**Freedom**](https://freedom.to/) shuts down your internet connection. :) I enjoyed their previous version more. It had just a timer, and no options. 

Other choices include Buddhify, The Mindfulness App and Stop Breathe & Think. I use an app called **Pranayama** to help with my deep breathing. It looks weird, but works like a charm.

To improve my sleep I use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/).

## Tools
I recommend looking at Amazon reviews for all of these products before ordering them. These are still early prototypes, and I think we're a year or so from having solid products in this space.

**Thync** works by sending signals to your nervous system. You can choose between boosting your calm and your focus.

**Spire** is a clip you put on your belt that supposed to measure breathing, and thus your level of stress. I bought one of these but stopped using it after a week because it had too many bugs in both the firmware and software.

**Muse Headband** measures your brain activity and gives you bio-feedback while you're meditating.
