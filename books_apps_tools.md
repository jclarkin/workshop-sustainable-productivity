# Books, apps & tools

A note before we start: some of these books, podcast etc. have buddhist or hindu themes. I am not a buddhist, nor a hindu, so keep in mind that you might have to just skim through the stuff that's too religiously tinted. Keep your scepticism high and look for reasoning and techniques that can be validated either in a lab or your own experience.

## Apps
[**Headspace**](http://www.headspace.com) is a great app for meditation. It's also the most expensive. Try their 10 free sessions and see if you like it.

[**Calm.com**](http://www.calm.com) is another popular choice, and more affordable than Headspace.

[**Thriver**](http://www.thriver.io) is the product I'm working on. In addition to guided and unguided meditations, Thriver also helps your organization track stress levels on a team basis. The app is free forever with no strings attached.

[**Self-Control**](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) shuts down distracting websites.

[**Freedom**](https://freedom.to/) shuts down your internet connection. :) I enjoyed their previous version more. It had just a timer, and no options. 

Other choices include Buddhify, The Mindfulness App and Stop Breathe & Think. I use an app called **Pranayama** to help with my deep breathing. It looks weird, but works like a charm. If you want to practice your breath at your laptop, use http://www.xhalr.com/.

To improve my sleep I use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/).

## Meditation trinkets
I recommend looking at Amazon reviews for all of these products before ordering them. These are still early prototypes, and I think we're a year or so from having solid products in this space.

**Thync** works by sending signals to your nervous system. You can choose between boosting your calm and your focus.

**Spire** is a clip you put on your belt that supposed to measure breathing, and thus your level of stress. I bought one of these but stopped using it after a week because it had too many bugs in both the firmware and software.

**Muse Headband** measures your brain activity and gives you bio-feedback while you're meditating.
