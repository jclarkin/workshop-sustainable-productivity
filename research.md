# Research

The best primer on how the brain works is the first two parts of this WaitButWhy post: http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html

## Research on stress and productivity
- "[The Global Benefits Attitudes survey](https://www.towerswatson.com/DownloadMedia.aspx?media=%7B581A704A-0635-43CA-8073-CB79D6FBCF52%7D) found that levels of workplace disengagement significantly increase when employees experience high levels of stress.  The study of 22,347 employees across 12 countries including the UK and US, revealed that over half of those employees claiming to be experiencing high stress levels reported they were disengaged.  By contrast, only one in ten employees claiming low stress levels reported they were disengaged and half of this group claimed to be highly engaged." 
- "Health care expenditures at high-pressure companies are [nearly 50% greater](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-11-642) than at other organizations."
- "In a [large-scale study](http://ki.se/en/news/poor-leadership-poses-a-health-risk-at-work) of over 3,000 employees conducted by Anna Nyberg at the Karolinska Institute, results showed a strong link between leadership behavior and heart disease in employees. Stress-producing bosses are literally bad for the heart."
- "[Sixty percent of lost workdays each year can be attributed to stress.](http://www.fdu.edu/newspubs/magazine/99su/stress.html)"
- "[When work begins to overlap with workers' personal life this implies a negative effect on productivity.](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17410401011052869)"
- "Research has found that different tasks require different levels of arousal for optimal performance. For example, difficult or intellectually demanding tasks may require a lower level of arousal (to facilitate concentration), whereas tasks demanding stamina or persistence may be performed better with higher levels of arousal (to increase motivation). [The downward part is caused by negative effects of arousal (or stress) on cognitive processes like attention (e.g., "tunnel vision"), memory, and problem-solving.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262607000322)"
- “[Stress can be something that makes you better, but it is a question of how much, how long and how you interpret or perceive it.](http://news.berkeley.edu/2013/04/16/researchers-find-out-why-some-stress-is-good-for-you/)”
- "[Programmer, interrupted.](http://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/)"
- [Activate sympathetic nervous system by notification.](http://jass.neuro.wisc.edu/2015/01/Lab%20601%20Group%2012.pdf)
- [Cognitive ability reduced by phone proximity](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/691462)
- [... the researchers found that participants who left their phones in another room significantly outperformed those with their phones anywhere physically close to them while taking the test.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201706/are-smartphones-making-us-stupid)

## Stress and health
There is a bunch of research that shows the negative effects of stress on the body. Everything from immune system to memory creation is affected. Long-term stress might even [cause depressions](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037).

- "Chronic stress may also cause disease, either because of changes in your body or the overeating, smoking and other bad habits people use to cope with stress. Job strain — high demands coupled with low decision-making latitude — is associated with increased risk of coronary disease, for example." [American Psychological Association](http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/stress.aspx)

However, a Stanford researcher claims that stress only causes health to deteriorate when we view stress as something negative. As long as we look at our stress in a positive way, it's not harmful.

- "[Viewing stress as a helpful part of life, rather than as harmful, is associated with better health, emotional well-being and productivity at work – even during periods of high stress.](https://news.stanford.edu/2015/05/07/stress-embrace-mcgonigal-050715/)"

There is another way to interpret this data. What if the respondents that report that they have a negative outlook on stress do that *because* they have experienced physical pain? Is this causation or correlation? We need further research to know for sure.

- [An event which exceeds the ability to cope does not necessarily have to occur in order for one to experience stress, as the threat of such an event occurring can be sufficient.]( http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/cognitive_appraisal_theories.htm)

## Research on meditation
There has been many studies on meditation in the last years. It has been proven to improve everything from immune system to psoriasis. However, few of the studies have had a double-blind placebo control group, so it's hard to know if these effects are caused by placebo. You could argue that if it works, it works. Or maybe it's just good to sit down for a while and chill for half an hour every day. We don't know yet.

Here's a list of studies on meditation, and what they say they've proven that it affects:
