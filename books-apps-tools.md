## Apps
**Headspace** is a great app for meditation. It's also the most expensive. Try their 10 free sessions and see if you like it.

**Calm.com** is another popular choice, and more affordable than Headspace.

**Thriver** is the product I'm working on. In addition to meditations, Thriver also helps your organization track stress levels on a team basis.

**Self-Control** shuts down distracting websites.

**Freedom** shuts down your internet connection. :)

## Tools
I recommend looking at Amazon reviews for all of these products before ordering them. These are still early prototypes, and I think we're a year or so from having solid products in this space.

**Thync** works by sending signals to your nervous system. You can choose between boosting your calm and your focus. 

**Spire** is a clip you put on your belt that supposed to measure breathing, and thus your level of stress. I bought one of these but stopped using it after a week because it had too many bugs in both the firmware and software.

**Muse Headband** measures your brain activity and gives you bio-feedback while you're meditating.
