# Workshop: Calm & Focused

**Please note:** I never read this script verbatim. I rarely even have the exact same content. I wrote this just to show an example of how a workshop could be done. That way, you can have something to start from. You should of course change content depending on the crowd and your own ideas, and you should never - ever - read a script :) Just use this as a starting point.

## Introduction
My name is Mattis. I started out as a Scrum Master and project manager at the age of 21. A few years later, on my way to Gothenburg to play a show with my band, I had to visit the hospital because of a pressure over my chest. The doctors said there was nothing wrong with me - I was just stressed. Which seemed weird to me, because I didn't feel stressed. I just did things I enjoyed - worked, trained, played with my band, some Dungeons & Dragons ...

A physiotherapist taught me a few methods that helped me calm down. After that, I started learning more about how stress affects the individual, a team, an organization, and even society. I started this company - Lightly - to help companies prevent stress *and* become more productive.

I'm not a doctor or therapists. I've just found things that worked for me and that are backed by science and that I want to share with you. You should question everything for yourself - Google the science behind it, try it out, see if it works. Please ask me during the workshop if there's anything you need me to clarify.

I promise you that I will stay after the workshop for as long as you want me to and talk more. I'm having dinner with my family at six, but I will stay until then. However, I will not be able to stop too long at a single topic during the talk itself. If I cut you off, just stay afterward and continue the discussion then.

This is what we're going to talk about today:

#### Contents
- Introduction
- Start with why
- How stress affects the body
- An evolutionary look at stress
- Stress productivity and flow
- Coping with stress
- Limiting distractions
    - Outer
    - Inner

- Summary and contact information

I've also tried to squeeze in much more, but I've taken it out again. Because, you know, we don't want this workshop to cause stress. However, I'd just like to show you the list of topics that didn't make it. Perhaps that will give you a clue on where to go after this workshop. So, this is what we're *not* going to talk about today:

#### Bonus topics
- Main causes of stress
- Yoga in relationship to mindfulness & meditation
- Deep breathing
- Gratitude & perspective
- The pro's of not being mindful
- Zen
- Meditation & achievement
- Emotional intelligence
- Breathing
- Types of meditation
- Other ways to train mindfulness
- The neuroscience of distraction
- Hierarchy of communication

But before we get started with these weird techniques, we need to ask ourselves the big question: *why*.

## Start with why
Why did you sign up for this session? What's the problem? Why are we not calm and focused already?

Mental illness is the number one reason for sick leave in Sweden. High stress levels is one of the main causes of mental illness. And still, we *accept* people to be stressed out. What I will try to say in this workshop is:

Don't accept it. A workplace that doesn't take burnouts seriously is not a great place to work.

The data is right here. Mental illness is the number one reason for sick leave. Let's forget about the moral parts of this, and just look at it from a business perspective:

#### Prioritizing stress management
- Less sick leave -> savings. (1 burnout = 500KSEK)
- Less stress -> More focus -> higher quality -> better product -> increased revenue.
- Increase employee well-being -> increased employee retention.
- Increased well-being -> talent attraction.

So these are our four *whys*. Productivity, savings and talent retention/attraction.

I think one of the main reasons we have this problem is that we don't understand stress. We think it's no big deal.

## How stress affects the body
Your body basically has two modes:
The "Fight or Flight mode" (the sympathetic autonomous nervous system) which helps you fight bears and run away from danger. Increased heart rate, sweating, dilated pupils. And the "Rest & Digest mode" which build up the immune system and, as the name suggests, digests food.

We activate the Fight or Flight mode when we're stressed. That's OK - for a while. But what happens when we're in this mode for a longer time period?

- Sleep quality declines
- Immune system flunks
- Food digestion stops
- Telomere length decreases
- Memory loss
- Less concentration

Stress was previously thought to cause cancer, but I haven't found any evidence that supports that. However, stress makes us prone to fall back on bad habits like smoking, drinking and eating sugar, which in turn cause a bunch of diseases.

From a personal standpoint, ask yourselves which version of yourself you are when you're stress. How's your patience? Your communication skills? Your memory?

Let's ponder this for a few seconds.

What's your main work tool? Your brain, right? So why would you accept your brain to be in a shitty state? Low concentration, low patience, bad memory ... it's like a soccer player accepting that her leg is broken.

This is what strikes me as most weird about stress. It's obviously making us bad at work, and yet we accept it as a fact.

Perhaps it's easier to understand if we look at our history as a species.

## An evolutionary look at stress
We're still monkeys, you know. The industrial revolution and the digital revolution are super short when looking at them from an evolutionary standpoint. Even tough our society have changed fast, our bodies haven't.

And that includes our brains.

We could look at it this way:
We've updated the environment, but the software is still the same version. That causes bugs. One input doesn't give us the output we're looking for.

And who's going to change that?

Our responses to tough situations - like a deadline - are the same as a caveperson had to fight a mammoth. The challenges are completely different, and yet we react in the same way.

Sweating doesn't help you write better emails. We still have physical reactions towards stress, even tough our "dangers" are mostly intellectual or social.

What was a danger to a caveperson is not a danger for us. Let's say you don't like me. You don't want me to come back. That would make me anxious. Why? Does it matter?

For a caveperson, it did. Being excluded from a tribe was the same thing as being left for dead. Our bodies haven't caught up with our new reality. My new reality is: there is no real danger. For me, right now, there is no danger.

The part of your brain responsible for identifying and reacting to danger is called the amygdala. It's been around for a loooong time. Whereas your reasoning, intelligent self - the prefrontal cortex - is much newer. We could say that the amygdala is in an 1.0, final and live, and the pre-frontal cortex is still in beta.

Therefore, the amygdala has the power to hijack the rest of the brain. If the amygdala sense some sort of danger, it can control our bodies fully. Even when our reasoning selves realize that there is nothing to worry about, the amygdala will hijack our body and make us ready for battle.

Now, remember: mental illness is the number one reason for sick leave. What we think about life and work actually affects our bodies to the point where we can't even get to work.

So why do we keep wanting people to be stressed?

Because we want to be productive.

## Stress, productivity and flow
[slide with Yerkes-Dodson graph, showing the relationship between productivity and stress on a bell curve]

Everything in this world can be plotted on a bell-curve. Even the relationship between stress and productivity.

Now, why is productivity de-creased when we are stressed?

- Memory
- Concentration
- Prioritization
- Bad choices
- Near-sighted
- Creativity
- Leadership

So, stress increases productivity. Up until a point. But many leaders I've met have only one button to push: the "increase stress"-button. Why? Why do we want to push people beyond this peak?

Because stress *feels productive.* We run around, send a bunch of emails, book meetings, write on Slack. We do lot's of things. But don't mistake motion for progress.

This bell curve looks different depending on the task. Let's say I'm a brain surgeon, about to perform surgery on your brain. How stressed to you want me to be on a scale from 1-10? And let's say I'm washing dishes. Where's my best stress level? The bell curve changes depending on the complexity and nature of the task.

Now, ask yourselves - what kind of tasks am I doing? Am I more of a brain surgeon or a dishwasher? What I find when I work with teams is that it differs. A project manager might be closer to washing dishes, where writing code is closer to surgery. But: they're equally stressed. And puzzled about the quality of the code ...

What's another name for this place of peak productivity, where we are very productive but not very stressed?

Flow. If we're too stressed - or not stressed enough - we won't be able to get there.

How do we increase stress? Challenging, meaningful tasks + direct feedback. (But not too challenging, we don't want to feel overwhelmed.)

You need at least fifteen minutes of uninterrupted work to get into a state of flow. How many times a day do you get to be uninterrupted for fifteen minutes?

This is why people tell me that they get their best jobs done when they're on a flight or working from home.

So we've built a culture where we *keep people from their maximum potential*.

We know how to increase stress - if now, we can always use Red Bull - but how about decreasing stress?

## Coping with stress
What methods do you currently use to decrease stress?

- Workouts
- Family and friends
- Sugar, alcohol, smoking, sex
- Creative endeavours
- Diary
- Therapy
- Nature

If we have all of these methods available - what's the problem?

1. We're not taking the time to decrease stress. We're not prioritizing it.
2. We're constantly online and available. We try to pay attention to everything, and, therefore, we have a hard time paying attention to anything.
3. Some of our jobs don't have feedback loops that let's us know when we are done.
4. We have no data on how's close to a burnout and who's not. We speak about stress in a binary way ("are you stressed or not?") while it's actually on a scale.

When I work with a team, we look at all of these factors. Today, I'm just going to talk about one of these: how we pay attention.

## Limiting distractions
We all have an attention budget that we choose how to spend.

Let's say I'm going to write some code. I have my Terminal and Atom and Postman up and running. I also have Slack. And Facebook on my phone. And Telegram. And I'm sitting in an office where there're people moving about. And I'm listening to music because I'm trying to focus. And I'm worried about something going on at home. And I'm thinking about that meeting we had this morning. Why didn't that person say hi to me when we met at the coffee machine?

In this example, how am I paying my attention? How am I distributing my budget? How much attention am I paying to the actual work? And how will that affect the quality of my code?

We know that multi-tasking is not as effective as multi-tasking. So why do we keep on doing it? Because, again, it *feels* productive.

When I'm saying yes to one of these things, I'm also saying no to something else. You can look at it like a backlog. If I add something new that I'm going to pay attention to, something else is not going to find into this sprint.

In this case, *subtraction is success.*

### Outer
[example of workspace]
The first thing we need to do is to limit physical distractions. Look at your average workspace. There are people trying to grab your attention, walking around, shouting ...

Create workspaces where everyone has access to focus rooms, which they can use when they want to limit distractions (to increase calm & focused work). Or allow people to work from wherever they want to.

If we force our co-workers to work in an environment that's distraction-inclined, what's going to happen? This is no rocket science, and yet we keep building open offices layouts. It should be a proactive choice of mine when I'm available for distractions. Today the standard is that you can bother me, and I have to make some sort of signal if it's not.

Yes - we need to collaborate. But if I'm constantly interrupted ... perhaps we are collaborating *too much*?

[example of windows including Slack ...]

What would you call a meeting that went on all day, with no agenda?
Slack.

Again, we need to collaborate. But what happens if you're constantly half-working, half-chatting, being available on your phone *and* available to those sitting next to you?

Some say that we're addicted to our distractions. But that's not true is it? Let's try and experiment. Can you turn off - I mean completely off - your phone for 45 minutes? Let's try it.

No wonder it's hard to stay calm & focused.

I recommend that you start using these two apps to help fight the problem:
1. Self-Control, which shuts down a list of websites.
2. Freedom, that shuts down the internet.

"Woah, I can't work without the internet." Of course you can. Do pomodoros of 45 minutes without the internet, and then spend 15 do find out the information you need. I write my best emails offline.

### Inner
When we've removed physical and digital distractions, we'll find out there's another layer to the problem: our mental distractions.

We are prone to mind-wandering. Thinking about the past, the future. One definition of intelligence is to create different mental scenarios and evaluate them. We're searching for possible dangers that we need to manage.

Sometimes we need to do this. But we also spend a lot of time worrying for no good reason.

There are a bunch of different methods to handle your mental distractions:
1. Write everything down.
2. Talk to a friend / coworker / boss.
3. Force yourself into flow by doing something challenging and meaningful. It's hard to worry about the future if you're riding a mountain bike or playing Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

And there's also mindfulness.

## Mindfulness
[ask the audience what mindfulness is]

There are a bunch of different definitions. "Paying attention in the present moment." If you ask a Buddhist monk, they'd say that mindfulness is much more than that: if we go out for lunch and you pick the beef, that's not very mindful of you.

For this reason, I rarely use mindfulness in my teaching. There are other words available that can get the job done, without the confusion. When I can switch mindfulness for presence or awareness, it almost always makes things clearer.

The whole point of mindfulness is this: our stress often comes from looking ahead. There's usually nothing *right now* that's dangerous. If we just stay in this moment, we don't have to be bothered by stress.

Let's try it out. Just sit for a while and pay attention to the present moment.

Now, what you'll realize, is that it's super hard to pay attention to the present moment. We are prone to mind-wandering, and when our mind wanders, it's prone to worry.

This is why we have meditation.

## Meditation
Meditation came up as a religious or philosophical technique to explore the nature of consciousness and to get rid of the illusion of the Self. As a side effect, meditators got very ... yes, calm and focused.

So we're hacking this by using meditation for it's side effects.

How do you meditate?

Just sit down and breathe. Find a focus point, such as the breath going in and out through your nose. As soon as you notice that you're not paying attention to the present moment, pull yourself back.

[try 5 minutes]

[ask the audience what they experienced]

So what we're doing is training ourselves to stay in the present moment. Mind wanders, mind comes back. Repeat.

Meditation is, as far as I know, the best method to increase calm and focus. There has been a number of studies supporting this in the last couple of years and I encourage you to Google the science behind this for your self.

There are a bunch of apps and trinkets, like a headband that helps you meditate using bio-feedback, to help you with your practice. Headspace is the most popular but also the most expensive. In the notes to this workshop, you'll find links to great books, apps, and tools to help you.

Remember this: meditation is like jogging. It's simple. The hard thing is actually taking the time. It's easy to get caught up in different techniques, traditions, apps - but that mostly keeps you away from actually doing it. Don't let anyone sell you anything. There are no licenses required to start meditating. It's like jogging. If you want get advanced - sure, perhaps it's good to have an experienced trainer. But for most of us, that's not the case.

## Group discussions
Make groups of 3-5 people and discuss how you could increase your teams calm and focus. In ten minutes I'll play a song, and that's your cue to stop talking. I'll then ask you to share your reflections with the group at large.

[wait 10 minutes]

## General discussion
[ask the groups if any of them wish to share what they came up with]

## Summary
- What looks/feels productive might not actually be. Be very selective with your attention. It is your most critical resource.
- Investing time in managing your brain has high ROI, because everything else you do depends on it.
- Mindfulness meditation is the best way to increase your ability to stay calm and focused (that I'm aware of).

As I said in the beginning, this is just a brief introduction to all of this field of thought. There is so much more to learn, test and discuss.

I'll stick around for as long as you want to, but if you'd rather keep in touch online, you can reach me on ...
