## Biz case (0:14)
If not from an empathic point of view .. this is expensive.

I think one of the main reasons we have this problem is that we don't understand stress. We think it's no big deal.

## Autonomous nervous systems (0:18)
Stress OK for a while. Even good!
Fight & Flight: pulse,
F&F: heart rate, muscles, Blood vessels contracts, Pupils dilate, Quick breathing. Preparing for a fight. OK short, but long: Immune system, memory, depression, cv disease, concentration …
No cancer, though. What version of yourself? Clarity? Creativity?

## Cave people (0:23)
Project / PO and dev. We’re still monkeys.
Threats for them vs. for us. Brain not diff.
Amygdala hijack. PSP. Buggy software. Old operative system. Input, output.
Still monkeys. Surroundings changes faster.
Physical reactions, mental/social "threats"
What we think about life and work actually affects our bodies to the point where we can't even get to work.

So why do we keep wanting people to be stressed? Because we want to be productive.

## Yerkes-dodson (0:26)
Everything bell-curve
Why stress decrease? Why do we want to push people beyond this peak?
Feels productive - motion / progress
Brain surgeon
Name for peak? Flow. Meaningful, challenging + uninterrupted
Best job at flights. Culture of distraction
Why prod. decrease? Surgery vs washing dishes. What’s your job? “dont time think”

Main work tool. Compare to physical worker (soccer)
We know how to increase stress - if now, we can always use Red Bull - but how about decreasing stress?

## Coping with stress (0:36)
What methods do you currently use to decrease stress?
Workouts, yoga, walks, social, prioritize ...
If that's not enough: what do we do? Fridays? Bad day at work?
If we have all of these methods available - what's the problem?
1. Not taking the time 2. Constantly available 3. Lack of feedback loops 4. Lack of data

When I work with a team, we look at all of these factors. Today, I'm just going to talk about one of these: how we pay attention.

## Paying attention
Pay attention (budget).
Why do we keep on multi-tasking? Social rewards? Self-worth? Lack singe-task ability?
Saying yes to everything = not saying yes to anything.
Subtraction is success. Limiting distractions.

## Example
How am I paying attention? Add phone, physical. Music as well. What would you call a meeting … We keep on adding distractions. Collaborate too much? Pro-active instead of re-active. Self-control + Freedom.

## Restlessness
[] After getting rid of distractions: boring. restlessness. Prone to mind-wandering. Sign of intelligent: scenarios + threats. Sometimes useful. How to get inner calm? Therapy. Friends. Journaling. If you have methods already, you might not need more.
For the rest of us … continuous “Therapy Light”

### Outer
Description average workplace. Focus rooms or remote.
Otherwise force them into distraction. Reactive instead of proactive
Yes - we need to collaborate. Perhaps too much?
All day meeting no agenda? One thing is fine. We keep on adding.
Addicted to distractions. Not true, right?
Self-control + freedom + focus room. Pro-active communication.

### Inner
Notice inner after outer removed. Prone to mind-wandering
Definition of intelligence. Scanning scenarios for danger.
Sometimes useful but many times not. How to fix?
1. Write. 2. Talk. 3. Force by MTB or BJJ

## Mindfulness (0:55)
[ask the audience what mindfulness is]
Different definitions. "Paying attention to present moment." Moral?
No need for the word. Swap for presence / awareness / concentration.
Point of mindfulness: nothing is happening right now.
Try it: sit and pay attention to present moment. Surrounding, thoughts, feelings, smells.
Realize it's hard. We'll forget. Sati - mindfulness - re-remembering
How to train?

## Meditation (0:00)
Religious technique with other purpose. Side-effect: calm + focused. How-to: just bring it back. [try 5 minutes] [ask the audience what they experienced] Training. Best method - challenge me. Google. Apps/trinkets. Don’t get caught up.
Like jogging. No cert needed. Practicing is the hard part.
Religious technique with other purpose. Side-effect: calm + focused.
How-to. Sit and breathe. Focus on present moment breath. Bring back.
[try 5 minutes]
Why meditation instead of something else?

## Group discussions (01:10)
3-5 ppl discuss how to improve calm+focus in your teams.
Bell ring in 10 minutes. Ask share findings/reflections with the rest

## General discussion (01:20)
[ask the groups if any of them wish to share what they came up with]

## Summary (01:26)
- Biz as usual doesn't work.
- Too much stress is unhealthy and un-productive.
(many of us are obviously too stressed)
- Don't mistake motion for progress
- Spend attention budget wisely
- Meditation is just one method

- Spend 20 mins every day on method X
- Start measuring in some way
- Remove all notifications/distractions. Be proactive.
- Set measurable goal on stress / sick leave.

- Investing time in managing your brain has high ROI, because everything else you do depends on it.
- Mindfulness meditation is the best way to increase your ability to stay calm and focused (that I'm aware of).
