## Bonus topics (14:07)

## Start with why (14:10)
Ask

## Sick leave (14:12)

## Biz case (14:14)
.. is why.

I think one of the main reasons we have this problem is that we don't understand stress. We think it's no big deal. 

## Autonomous nervous systems (14:18)
Stress OK for a while.

## Effects of stress on body (14:21)
No cancer
What version of your self
Main work tool

## Cave people (14:23)
Still monkeys. Surroundings changes faster.
Physical reactions, mental/social "threats"
Amygdala hijac
What we think about life and work actually affects our bodies to the point where we can't even get to work.

So why do we keep wanting people to be stressed? Because we want to be productive.

## Yerkes-dodson (14:26)
Everything bell-curve
Why stress decrease? Why do we want to push people beyond this peak?
Feels productive - motion / progress
Brain surgeon
Name for peak? Flow. Meaningful, challenging + uninterrupted
Best job at flights. Culture of distraction

We know how to increase stress - if now, we can always use Red Bull - but how about decreasing stress?

## Coping with stress (14:36)
What methods do you currently use to decrease stress?
If we have all of these methods available - what's the problem?
1. Not taking the time 2. Constantly available 3. Lack of feedback loops 4. Lack of data

When I work with a team, we look at all of these factors. Today, I'm just going to talk about one of these: how we pay attention.

## Limiting distractions (14:45)
Pay attention - budget. Example of code + distractions.
We know multi-tasking... and yet ... why?
Saying yes = saying no. What are you saying yes to?
Subtractions is success

### Outer 
Description average workplace. Focus rooms or remote.
Otherwise force them into distraction. Reactive instead of proactive
Yes - we need to collaborate. Perhaps too much?
All day meeting no agenda? One thing is fine. We keep on adding.
Addicted to distractions. Not true, right?
Self-control + freedom + focus room. Pro-active communication.

### Inner
Notice inner after outer removed. Prone to mind-wandering
Definition of intelligence. Scanning scenarios for danger.
Sometimes useful but many times not. How to fix? 
1. Write. 2. Talk. 3. Force by MTB or BJJ

## Mindfulness (14:55)
[ask the audience what mindfulness is]
Different definitions. "Paying attention to present moment." Moral?
No need for the word. Swap for presence / awareness / concentration.
Point of mindfulness: nothing is happening right now. 
Try it: sit and pay attention to present moment. Surrounding, thoughts, feelings, smells.
Realize it's hard. We'll forget. Sati - mindfulness - re-remembering
How to train?

## Meditation (15:00)
Religious technique with other purpose. Side-effect: calm + focused.
How-to. Sit and breathe. Focus on present moment breath. Bring back.
[try 5 minutes]
[ask the audience what they experienced]
Training.
Best method. Challenge me. Google. Find other methods.
Apps/trinkets. 
Like jogging. No certification required. Practicing is the hard part.

## Group discussions (15:10)
3-5 ppl discuss how to improve calm+focus in your teams.
Bell ring in 10 minutes. Ask share findings/reflections with the rest

## General discussion (15:20)
[ask the groups if any of them wish to share what they came up with]

## Summary (15:26)
- Stress is not cool. Making us sick and it's expensive.
- What looks/feels productive might not actually be. Be very selective with your attention. It is your most critical resource.
- Investing time in managing your brain has high ROI, because everything else you do depends on it.
- Mindfulness meditation is the best way to increase your ability to stay calm and focused (that I'm aware of).

This is just a brief intro.
I'll stick around.
