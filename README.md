### Why open source?
For a couple of reasons.

1. There is a lot of bullshit in the space that I'm working in. Snake-oil salesmen will tell you that they have the Key To Happiness And Success. By releasing my material under an open source license, I hope that other companies within my line of business will be forced to become more transparent. 
2. By releasing the material for free, I also open up for more feedback. This will increase the quality of my work faster.
3. To show that you don't need a certification to start teaching these methods. AIt's like jogging. Once you know the basics of jogging, you can teach others to do that.
4. By helping to create more teachers, I increase the competition which should lead to higher quality which is better for everyone.
