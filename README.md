# Workshop: Focused & Fearless
This workshop aims to increase focus and decrease stress in a tech company. We look closer at mindfulness and meditation as tools for reaching that goal, and also learn how stress affects the body and productivity.

After you've completed the workshop, I recommend moving on to the 8-week course. You can find it here on GitHub:

### Why open source?
For a couple of reasons.

1. There is **so much bullshit** going on in the mindfulness/coaching space. Open source forces me to be transparent about what I do, which I hope inspire more people to do the same. That way we can (hopefully) weed out some of the scam.
2. By open sourcing, the material is more open to feedback and comments. That will increase the quality of the workshop faster.
3. To show that you don't need a certification to start teaching these methods. A lot of people want your money, but these methods are thousands of years old and are free and available to anyone. Like jogging. Just fork and get going.
4. By helping to create more teachers, I increase the competition which should lead to higher quality which is better for everyone.

## Workshop summary
Key takeaway: optimize your team's mental state for flow:

- meaningful, challenging tasks
- create a distraction-free environment (digital, physical and mental)
- it’s worth spending time to increase ability to stay calm and focus.
- … mindfulness meditation is the best method for this that I'm aware of.

### Stress

- Stress is good – up until a point. See the Yerkes-Dodson law: ∩
- Many of us spend work hours being more stressed than we should be. Too stressed → low focus, low creativity, low concentration and physical health
- Stress is caused by workloads, lack of feedback loops, troublesome relationships, and no balance between responsibility and authority, not knowing priorities.
- Our reactions to stress is result of evolution. Was super good in stoneage for physical threats. Distractions might be life-threatening. ”Threats” / ”danger” is intellectual now. We don't need faster heart beats.
- We have lots of methods to increase stress: caffeine, notifications, angry customers, mission statements, etc.
- … but we need more methods to lower stress.
- … or, just spend more time on the ones we already know.

### Meditation

- started out as a religious tool to increase insight and reach exstatic states of conciousness
- ”side-effects” include focus, concentration, calm, happiness, presence
- science have proven these effects in the last couple of years
- Use meditation in your team to lower stress and increase focus
- The method is simple: sit down, focus on your breath. Once distracted, bring focus back.
- Simple method you can use almost anywhere by anyone.
- Free of charge. No mantras/cushions/beards needed.

### Flow

- state of optimal productivity without stress
- high levels of flow also related to high levels of happiness
- different stress levels needed depending on tasks. Mountain bike not same as brain surgery.
- Need challenging, meaningful tasks and no distractions to get into a state of flow.
- Feeling of ”f- yeah, I'm good at this” + time disappears → signs of flow
- Computer games usually easiest way to experience flow.

### Data

- measure teams stress levels to know if where in the right place
- without data, stress is usually binary: ”are you stressed or not?”
- binary stress levels not very helpful since everyone in tech is kind of stressed
- We've built **Thriver** to do this: [www.thriver.io](http://www.thriver.io)
- Now you're able to make decision based on data to optimize for flow. Increase or decrease depending on team's state of mind.

### Other

- apps such as Freedom (freedom.to) and Self-Control (selfcontrolapp.com) are helpful to create distraction-free environment. Silent focus rooms – and/or times of day – is usually needed as well.
- No distractions will need to new levels of communication. Do I really need to send this email, or bother someone in person? Can I write a more thorough email?
- Don't mistake motion for progress. Genuis inventions look simple from the outside. Lots of noise != productivity.
- Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter & Square, wakes up 30mins early every morning to meditate. Why? Investment of time: rest of day more productive = valuable investment.
- No need to use the word mindfulness. Just remove distractions and do things that are meaningful and challening. The rest will take care of itself.
- To prioritze optimal mental states could mean to tell the people to care less about project. Decreased stress → increased productivity → better end result. Counter-intuitive for managers.
