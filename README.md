# Workshop: Focused & Fearless
This workshop introduces mindfulness meditation as a practice to increase focus and decrease stress in a tech company.

The point of open sourcing it is simple. I want more people to learn these methods. Fork this repo, update the script for your own teaching style, and get going. 

After you've completed the workshop, I recommend moving on to the 8-week course. You can find it here on GitHub:
