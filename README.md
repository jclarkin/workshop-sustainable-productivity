# Workshop: Focused & Fearless
This workshop introduces mindfulness meditation as a practice to increase focus and decrease stress in a tech company.

The point of open sourcing it is simple. I want more people to learn these methods. Fork this repo, update the script for your own teaching style, and get going. You needn't ask for anyones permission to start teaching. 

After you've completed the workshop, I recommend moving on to the 8-week course. You can find it here on GitHub:
