# Workshop: Sustainable Productivity
This workshop aims to increase focus and decrease stress in a tech company. We look closer at mindfulness and meditation as tools for reaching that goal, and also learn how stress affects the body and your working capacity.

After you've completed the workshop, I recommend moving on to the 8-week course. You can find it here on GitHub:

### Why open source?
For a couple of reasons.

1. There is **so much bullshit** going on in the mindfulness/coaching space. Open source forces me to be transparent about what I do, which I hope inspire more people to do the same. That way we can (hopefully) weed out some of the scam.
2. By open sourcing, the material is more open to feedback and comments. That will increase the quality of the workshop faster.
3. To show that you don't need a certification to start teaching these methods. A lot of people want your money, but these methods are thousands of years old and are free and available to anyone. Like jogging. Just fork and get going.
4. By helping to create more teachers, I increase the competition which should lead to higher quality which is better for everyone.
