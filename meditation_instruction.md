# Meditation instruction
Below are a couple of "levels" that you can base your practice on. I've stolen them from Culadasas *The Mind Illuminated*. 

You can find more tips & tricks related to your meditation practice at these sites:

## Level 1
Level 1 is all about introducing meditation to our lives and creating the habit. You don't have to be "good" at meditation or achieve anything. Just sit and breathe.

#### Technique
Sit down for at least 20 minutes.
Breathe.
Be aware of the breath, your body, your thoughts, your feelings, the surrounding.
Keep your concentration on the breath.
When you notice the mind drifting, bring it back to the present moment.

#### Goal
28 days of meditation without failure.
Don't move on to the next level until you've finished this.

## Level 2
Level 2 is about increasing concentration. Don't worry about this until you've finished level 1.

#### Goal
Minutes of concentration, with only seconds of mind-wandering.


#### Technique
1. What's your motivation behind taking the time?
2. What do you hope to achieve during todays meditation?
3. What are you expectations of todays session?
4. What do you think will distract you today?
5. Do you intend to be diligent during todays practice?
6. Will you keep a raised spine and lifted chin?
7. Are you aware of your surroundings?
8. Are you aware of your body?
9. Are you aware of the breath?
10. Can you find a point connected to the breath to concentrate on?

Start counting to ten. Ourbreath 1, inbreath 1. Outbreath 2, inbreath 2. If you loose track, start over.

Once you've hit 10, stop counting.

Once you notice your mind drifting, bring it back to the focus point.
