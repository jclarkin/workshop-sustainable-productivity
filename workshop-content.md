## Introduction
My name is Mattis. I started out as a Scrum Master and project manager pretty early, at the age of 20. A few years ago, I had to visit the hospital because experienced pressure over my chest. A physiotherapist taught me how to cope with stress in a healthy way.

After that, I started learning more about how stress affects the individual, a team, an organization and even society. I started this Company - Lightly - to help teams prevent stress. Perhaps that will lead to someone not having to visit the hospital.

This is going to be a basic workshop on increasing stress and focus. I'd like to dive in at length on every section, but I'd rather give you a framework for helping you think about these matters. I don't think there'll be any "aha"-moments - but we don't need this to be more advanced. We need to start doing the things we know are good.

Some things in this workshop are quite controversial - such as the notion that "collaboration is overrated." I would love to discuss all of these ideas with you, and I'll be happy to stay after the workshop and do that for as long as you want me to. However, if we're going to discuss these matters during the workshop, we will not make it all the way through. I therefore ask you to save your thoughts until the discussion part in the end, or stick around afterwards and talk more.

Please do feel free to ask me to clarify anything that you don't understand.


## Start with why
[First, ask the audience why they signed up for this workshop.]

Mental illness is the number one reason for sick leave in Sweden. High stress levels is one of the main causes of mental illness (burnouts).

Stress makes people less satisfied at work and makes them look for other employers.

### The business case for prioritizing stress prevention
- Less sick leave -> savings.
- More focus -> higher quality -> better product -> increased revenue.
- Increase employee well-being -> increased employee retention.
- Increased well-being -> talent attraction.

## How stress affects the body
Your body basically has two modes:
The "Fight or Flight mode" (the sympathethic autonomous nervous system) which helps you fight bears and run away from danger. Increased heart rate, sweating, dilated pupils. And the "Rest & Digest mode" which build up the immune system and, as the name suggests, digests food.

We activate the Fight or Flight mode when we're stressed. That's OK - for a while. But what happens when we're in this mode for a longer time period?

- Sleep
- Immune system
- Food digestion
- Telomere length
- Memory

Stress was previously thought to cause cancer, but I haven't found any evidence that supports that. However, stress makes us prone to fall back on bad habits like smoking, drinking and eating sugar, which in turn cause diseases.

From a personal standpoint, ask yourselves which version of yourself you are when you're stress. How's your patience? Your communication skills? Your memory?

## An evolutionary look at stress
We're still monkeys, you know. The industrial revolution and the digital revolution are super short when looking at them from an evolutionary standpoint. Even tough our societys have changed fast, our bodies haven't.

And that includes our brains.

We could look at it this way:
We've updated the environment, but the software is still the same version. That causes bugs. One input doesn't give us the output we're looking for.

And who's going to change that?

Our responses to tough situations - like a deadline - are the same as a caveperson had to fighting a mammoth. The challenges are completely different, and yet we react in the same way.

## Stress, productivity and flow
[slide with Yerkes-Dodson graph, showing the relationship between productivity and stress]

Everything in this world can be plotted on an upside-down U. Even the relationship between stress and productivity.

Now, why is productivity de-creased when we are stressed?

- Memory
- Concentration
- Prioritization
- Bad choices
- Near-sighted
- Creativity
- Leadership

And the weird part is: we accept stress. In some workplaces, we even encourage stress. Why?

Because stress *feels productive.*

This peak-productivity is also called flow. If we're too stressed - or not stressed enough - we wont't be able to get there. How do we increase stress? Challenging, meaningful tasks + direct feedback. (But not too challenging, we don't want to feel overwhelmed.)

You need at least fifteen minutes of uninterrupted work to get into a state of flow. How many times a day do you get to be uninterrupted for fifteen minutes?

This is why people tell me that they get their best jobs done when they're on a flight or working from home.

So we've built a culture where we *keep people from their maximum potential*.

## Coping with stress
[ask the audience how they decrease stress]

- Workouts
- Family and friends
- Sugar, alcohol, smoking, sex
- Creative endeavours

Other methods:

- Diary
- Therapy
- Nature

If we have all of these methods available - what's the problem?

## Paying attention
What causes stress and how we handle it depends on how we *pay attention.* We all have an attention budget that we choose how to spend.

Most people I meet spend their attention very sloppy. They give many things perpetual and partial attention. If we spend our attention another way, we might both be able to increase focus and decrease stress. Let's look at three basic ways.

### Physical
[example of workspace]
The first thing we need to do is to limit physical distractions. Look at your average workspace. There are people trying to grab your attention, walking around, shouting ...

Create workspaces where everyone has access to focus rooms, which they can use when they want to limit distractions (to increase calm & focused work). Or allow people to work from wherever they want to.

If we force our coworkers to work in an environment that's distraction-inclined, what's going to happen? This is no rocket science, and yet we keep building open offices layouts. It should be a pro-active choice of mine when I'm available for distractions. Today the standard is that you can bother me, and I have to make some sort of signal if it's not.

Yes - we need to collaborate. But if I'm constantly interrupted ... perhaps we are collaborating *too much*?

### Digital
[example of windows including Slack ...]

What would you call a meeting that went on all day, with no agenda?
Slack. 

Again, we need to collaborate. But what happens if you're constantly half-working, half-chatting, being available on your phone *and* available to those sitting next to you?

Phone distractions... try to turn them off during the rest of the workshop. Prove that you're not addicted.

No wonder it's hard to stay calm & focused.

I recommend that you start using these two apps to help fight the problem:
1. Self-Control, which shuts down a list of websites.
2. Freedom, that shuts down internet.

"Woah, I can't work without the internet." Of course you can. Do pomodors of 45 minutes without the internet, and then spend 15 do find out the information you need. 

### Mental
When we've removed physical and digital distractions, we'll find out there's another layer to the problem: our mental distractions.

We are prone to mind-wandering. Thinking about the past, the future. One definition of intelligence is to create different mental scenarios and evaluate them. We're searching for possible dangers that we need to manage.

Sometimes we need to do this. But we also spend a lot of time worrying for no good reason. 

There are a bunch of different methods to handle your mental distractions:
1. Write everything down.
2. Talk to a friend / coworker / boss.
3. Force yourself into flow by doing something challenging and meaningful. It's hard to worry about the future if you're riding a mountain bike or playing brazilian jiu-jitsu.

## Mindfulness
[ask the audience what mindfulness is]

There are a bunch of different definitions. "Paying attention in the present moment." If you ask a buddhist monk, they'd say that mindfulness is much more than that: if we go out for lunch and you pick the beef, that's not very mindful of you.

For this reason, I rarely use mindfulness in my teaching. There are other words available that can get the job done, without the confusion. "Mental presence" is one. "Now-attention" is another.

The whole point is this: our stress often comes from looking ahead. There's usually nothing *right now* that's dangerous. If we just stay in this moment, we don't have to be bothered by stress.

Let's try it out. Just sit for a while and pay attention to the present moment.

## Meditation
Now, what you'll realize, is that it's super hard to pay attention to the present moment. We are prone to mind-wandering, and when our mind wanders, it's prone to worry.

This is why we have meditation.

Meditation came up as a religious or philosophical technique to explore the nature of conciousness and to get rid of the illusion of the Self. As a side effect, meditators got very ... yes, calm and focused.

So we're hacking this by using meditation for it's side effects.

How do you meditate?

Just sit down and breathe. Find a focus point, such as the breath going in and out through your nose. As soon as you notice that you're not paying attention to the present moment, pull yourself back.

[try 5 minutes]

[ask the audience what they experienced]

Meditation is, as far as I know, the best method to increase calm and focus. There has been a number of studies supporting this in the last couple of years and I encourage you to Google the science behind this for your self.

There are a bunch of apps and trinkets, like a headband that helps you meditate using bio-feedback, to help you with your practice. Headspace is the most popular but also the most expensive. In the notes to this workshop you'll find links to great books, apps and tools to help you.

## Group discussions
Make groups of 3-5 people and discuss how you could increase your teams calm and focus. In ten minutes I'll play a song, and that's your cue to stop talking.

## Generel discussion
[ask the groups if any of them wish to share what they came up with]

## Summary
- What looks/feels productive might not actually be.
- Investing time in managing your wetware has high ROI, because everything else you do depends on it.
- Mindfulness meditation is the best way to increase your ability to stay calm and focused (that I'm aware of).
