## Meta

Phones. Off or on? Note: at least two breaks for emergencies.

Note taking. Website, Github. I&#39;m not an expert: here to learn and discuss. &quot;This is what I&#39;ve got.&quot;

Need help from one person to write _our_ notes on whiteboard.

Goal: create sustainble productivity by reflecting on relationship stress, productivity, mental health.

Why? Reasons for signing up. Write down and get back to in the end.

## Overview subject

Presentation Mattis. Scrum master, playing in band, hospital visit because of too much stress.

Not an expert. Looking at experts, it&#39;s all &quot;common knowledge.&quot; Key is to identify specifics.

Data in Sweden: most common reason sick leave. +14% of all emergencies &quot;acute stress reaction&quot;

Most common females 30/40. Stress correlated, but not causing cancer. Why? Unhealthy methods.

Groups: why are we exhausting ourselves? Playing music = time to wind down discussion.

## Is stress good or bad?

Not binary. Not two different kinds of stress. Compare to exercise / calories / whatever.

## Cause I'm a fucking cave man

Homo sapiens sapiens not changed for 50 000 years. Not built for this environment. &quot;Bugs&quot;

What made us more successfull than other species: ability to plan &amp; cooperate.

Not able to survive alone = social part of stress often most important. But not talked about.

Thinking about problem in future = enough to react now. Always worrying about future = :(

Fight or flight or freeze. What do we need to run from? Opposite is rest &amp; digest.

## Neuroscience of stress

Amygdala(s) part of limbic system. Very very old (frogs have them!), iterated and QA:d.

Quick fast-and-up system. Overrides thinking part of brain – the prefrontal cortex. Self talking.

Subconscious identification of danger, not rational. What do you need to be afraid of? Smoking.

We&#39;re built differently. Some have larger / more active amygdalas and stressed out more.

Different environments shape us. Bad family situation with &quot;danger&quot; causes amygdala to grow.

Good news that brain is plastic. We can change. 8 weeks of meditation shrinks amygdala.

## Challenge response

Why doesn&#39;t saying &quot;Don&#39;t worry&quot; solve the problem? We&#39;ve already tried not to worry!

Different reactions to challenge (psyched!) and danger (scared!). We can change mindset.

Examine the worst case. Realize it&#39;s not bad. Now it&#39;s a challenge. We can lower/raise bar.

Reality check: burnouts are often related to workaholism. Rarely only work.

## Yerkes-Dodson

More stress can be good.

Leadership: talk about meaning, mission, values.

Industrial view of work. Rather have you at desk for 8 hours.

With simple task, it doesn&#39;t matter how stressed out we are: we&#39;ll do OK anyway. Cleaning.

With complex tasks, we need the perfect amount of stressed. Surgeon. (cover faces example)

## Let&#39;s solve the problem

Usually trying to fix it to quick. &quot;Everyone should do meditation!&quot; Rather, it depends on root cause.

First we need to reflect to find out where the problem is. Simple, but not always easy.

All methods are free. If they don&#39;t work, email me and request new methods. Compare deadlift.

## Mindfulness &amp; meditation

Supposed to be non-religious. But if you dig in, the Buddha pops out. Not compatible all religions.

However, rename method to presence. Reseach indicates it reduces anxiety but no placebo controls.

Why would it work? 1. Disconnect 2. Not think about future. 3. Breathing activates PNS.

Meditation can be defined a million ways. Just sitting, breathing, and focusing on the breath.

Some people hate meditation and that&#39;s OK. Just do something else like taking walks or talking.

## Relationship between workload and stress

Key questions: are you in control? What&#39;s the worst case? Do you have support? Recovery time?

= our mental image of the world will reflect how we react towards workload.

## Practice: understand and experiment

Divide group into those who want to be alone (journal, walk, meditation) and talkers.

Groups talkers together into those who&#39;d rather coach and those who need help.

Coffee OK, but don&#39;t pick up phones/laptops yet. No need to share if you don&#39;t feel comfortable.

Ask questions first. Don&#39;t try to solve. Find root cause. Then suggest experiment, not solution.

## Most common solutions

Flow hours: separate room, use Freedom / Self-Control to shut down internet

”You belong here” might seem childish. But lower stress → increase productivity → worth it.


## Questions, reflections, thoughts

Pick up on what was written down in beginning.

Google practice: one simple thing. If there is one thing you want to take away from this workshop...

Always free to email me with questions and feedback. I will send out slides etc.

Thank you + don&#39;t forget to pick up phones :)
